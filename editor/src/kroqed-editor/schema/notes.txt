A document contains:

{ markdown content } => also includes math-inline.
{ coq code }
{ math display }

These three are considered 'cells'

"```coq\n" needs to be translated to "<coqblock>"
"\n```" needs to be translated to "</coqblock>"
Math nodes still need to be encapsulated in <math-display> and <math-inline>



We differentiate between a 'markdown' cell and a 'container' cell.
markdown cell: 
- p, h, lists
container cell:
- markdown cell
- math display
- codeblock
