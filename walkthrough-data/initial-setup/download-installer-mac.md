# Download the Installer for MacOS and allow execution

## Download the installer

Download and execute the bundled installer `Waterproof_Background.dmg` from the [release page](https://github.com/impermeable/waterproof-dependencies-installer/releases/latest)

Open the `Waterproof_Background.dmg` and drag `Waterproof_Background.app` into the "Applications". You may need to provide administrative access to do this.

## Allow Execution of the background software

Initially, MacOS will likely block the execution of the necessary background program. To fix this issue, click 'Show in Finder', look for Coq-Platform, Control-click on the Coq-Platform application and press open. Click 'open' again if a pop-up appears. You may close the application once it has opened. This will ensure that the application is now trusted when using the Waterproof extension in the future.
