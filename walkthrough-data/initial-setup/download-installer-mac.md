# Download the Installer for MacOS and allow execution

<!-- 1. Download and execute the bundled installer `Waterproof_Background.dmg` from the [release page](https://github.com/impermeable/waterproof-dependencies-installer/releases/latest)

2. Open the `Waterproof_Background.dmg` and drag `Waterproof_Background.app` into the "Applications" folder. You may need to provide administrative access to do this.

3. Initially, MacOS will likely block the execution of the necessary background program. To fix this issue, click 'Show in Finder', look for Waterproof_Background, Control-click on the Waterproof_Background application and press open. Click 'open' again if a pop-up appears. You may close the application once it has opened. This will ensure that the application is now trusted when using the Waterproof extension in the future. -->

1. Currently Waterproof must be downloaded manually, no installer is available for Mac.

2. Follow the steps in the README on https://github.com/impermeable/waterproof-vscode to download the required packages.
