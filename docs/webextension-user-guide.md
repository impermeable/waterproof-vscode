# Using Waterproof in the browser

1. Download your exercise sheets and save them in a location of your choice.
2. Go to `www.vscode.dev?enable-coi` using Google Chrome or Chromium.
3. Go to extensions (Ctrl+Shift+x), search for Waterproof and install it.
4. Go to files (Ctrl+Shift+e), click "Open folder" and choose the folder from step 1.
5. If the browser asks for permission to view or edit files in that location,
allow this.
6. Open a `.mv` file. A goals window should open to the right automatically.
