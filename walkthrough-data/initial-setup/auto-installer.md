# Automatic Installer

When running the automatic installer, a terminal window will appear and automatically download the necessary installer/packages onto your machine.

If an instance of waterproof has already been installed on the machine, it will first be uninstalled and a pop-up will request permission for this.

Use all default locations and prompts for the easiest installation experience.

This installer is then run before being deleted once all libraries have been successfully installed.
The lsp path is also updated in the Waterproof settings according to the operating system being used.

Close the terminal when the installation is complete to continue using Waterproof.
